### Overview

In this workshop, you will deploy a **dynamic e-commerce website** using the Hugo framework on the AWS Cloud platform. You will learn how to prepare your environment, configure your AWS account, build the website with Hugo, and deploy the entire system using essential AWS services such as API Gateway, S3, Lambda, CloudFormation, DynamoDB, Route 53, CloudWatch, and leverage SAM CLI to automate the deployment process.

Additionally, you will be guided through **setting up a static website on S3 with full SSL (HTTPS) support** to enhance security and professionalism, ensuring your website serves customers globally with confidence.
